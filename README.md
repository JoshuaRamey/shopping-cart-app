# shopping-cart-app
(work-in-progress) A shopping cart simulator in React JS. Right now you can switch between product categories to be displayed
and add them to your cart. The cart will display how many items it contains. Next I need to add an option to render items in the
cart, display the total, and find a way to work with multiples of the same item in the cart at a time so as not to display
duplicates in the render.
