# shopping-cart-app
A shopping cart simulator in React JS. Add items to the cart, the cart icon will display how many icons are in the cart at present. When viewing the cart there is a table which displays the subtotal, tax, and total payment due. Delete items from your cart and the payment info will update. Adding duplicates of the same item will increase the quantity of the item in the cart, as opposed to duplicating it entirely. Removing the an item will decrease the quantity, unless there is a quantity of one in which case it will remove the item from the cart entirely. Payment updates according to the items in the cart and their quantity.



#### Update (January 2020)
I worked on this project as practice while I was looking for my first job. My skills have increased dramatically since that point, and this project no longer represents my skill as a developer. However, I am leaving the project on GitHub to keep a record of some of my earliest projects and show how far I have progressed.
